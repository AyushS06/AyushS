                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Ayush Sharma and welcome to my portfolio webiste! A quick introduction of me: 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        I graduated from Alpharetta High School in 2019 and have experience in multiple fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Technology, and Engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        I co-founded a college consulting and tutoring in 2019 company called 4 Years with my high school friends, Manoj and Jason. 4 Years is a company that helps provide assistance to international and domestics students to place into elite US universities. 
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> 
                        I worked with multinational corporations such as Lockheed Martin and Microsoft. At Lockheed Martin, I developed a quadcopter with a team of 3 of my peers. At Microsoft, I helped teach high school and middle school students about the wonders of Computer Science in the language of Java.
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> 
                        From there, I expanded to local schools in my county, Fulton County, such as Creek View Elementary School, Webb Bridge Middle School, Cambridge High School, Johns Creek High School, and Chattahoochee High School. 
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> 
                        In all of those schools, I taught students about my honor society, NTHS, and the power of technology in today’s modern world.
                    </p>
                    <br>   
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Besides my main passion being Computer programming, some of my other passions include soccer, traveling, and photography.
                    </p>
